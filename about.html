<hr />
<p>I am currently a student. So I do not have too much free time, or money to throw around traveling. I like to get the best bang for the buck and I like to buy products that will last me a long time. Travel on the cheap is what I aim for, not a fan of travel agencies that charge astronomical rates to tell you what you are going to do on your vacation time.</p>
<p>I hope to travel to many parts of the world on the cheap and share my experiences, but for now I will be spending most of my time tied to one place until I finish my degree.</p><p>
