		<p class="container"><p>Some of what I want to share on this blog is documents of my travels and some projects that I am working on. I want a place to share some ideas and document where I have been and where I am planning to go. </p>
<p>So far there is not many places I can go right now. The one big cross country road trip that I had planned got killed when the covid-19 pandemic started, and I have been stuck in the same place ever since. Being stuck in one place wasn't inherently a bad thing, as I was able to dedicate time to other projects such as setting up this blog. While there were many terrible things that have happened during the pandemic I was trying to make the most out of being stationary. </p>
<p>I was lucky enough to keep my health up during the past year and I have picked up some responsibilities that are going to take up my time until school starts up again. It may be a while until I can do some extended travel, but thats ok. Not much to do except to enjoy where I currently am.</p><p>
